# AGENTS.md

This file defines repository-wide engineering principles, the development lifecycle, and when specialist Skills must be invoked.

Detailed procedures belong in each Skill's `SKILL.md`. Do not duplicate them here.

## Principles

Priority:

`Correctness -> Simplicity -> Architecture Clarity -> Maintainability -> Extensibility`

* Follow Occam's razor: prefer the simplest necessary and maintainable solution.
* Understand the existing architecture before making non-trivial changes.
* Prefer minimal changes, existing capabilities, mature frameworks, and clear interfaces.
* Do not introduce speculative abstractions, services, features, or dependencies.
* Keep responsibilities and module/service boundaries clear.
* Fix root causes instead of hiding problems with additional complexity.

## Documentation

* Keep `README.md` as the project introduction and documentation index.
* Put detailed documentation under `docs/`.
* Keep documents focused on one module or topic.
* Update documentation only when verified behavior, architecture, interfaces, dependencies, deployment, or important project state changes.

## Development Workflow

Use the lightest workflow that preserves correctness.

For non-trivial work:

`Requirement -> Understand repo -> Plan -> Slice / Ticket if needed -> Create branch -> Implement -> Test -> Redaction scan if applicable -> Commit -> Push branch -> Create / Update PR -> Automatic Review -> Fix / Test / Redaction / Commit / Push / Review loop -> Merge PR -> Delete branch -> Update main -> Close Ticket -> Update State/Docs -> Deploy if needed`

Use `codex-development-workflow` to orchestrate the lifecycle.

For each slice:

`Acceptance Criteria -> Test Strategy -> Minimal Change -> Focused Validation -> Complete`

* Work on one clear functional unit per agent at a time; independent Slices may run in parallel only through the delegation gate.
* When requirements are numerous, cross multiple behaviors, or have dependencies, split them into behavior Tickets first, then split each Ticket into independently verifiable Slices.
* Every change type uses the same feature-branch and PR gate: docs, code, tests, configuration, refactors, bug fixes, features, dependencies, and CI/CD changes must not bypass the PR.
* Split complex or dependency-driven work into small, independently verifiable slices.
* Run the smallest validation set that provides sufficient evidence.
* Use test-first development when it materially improves correctness, especially for bugs, regressions, business logic, APIs, and high-risk behavior.
* Do not force strict TDD or decomposition overhead onto trivial changes; a tiny request may remain one implicit Slice, but it still requires a branch and PR.
* After the PR is created, run the automatic review without waiting for user confirmation. Blocking findings repeat the fix, test, redaction, commit, push, and review steps.
* If an implementation exposes an incorrect design assumption, re-plan instead of expanding the patch.
* Do not mix unrelated features, refactors, formatting, or dependency upgrades.

## Multi-Agent Delegation

Use subagents only when delegation materially improves speed, context isolation, or review quality.

The main agent owns:

* requirements;
* architecture and design decisions;
* planning and task decomposition;
* dependency ordering;
* integration;
* final judgment.

Delegate work only when the task is bounded and independently executable.

Good delegation targets include:

* repository exploration;
* independent research;
* independent test or regression analysis;
* isolated implementation slices;
* independent review.

Keep dependent or overlapping work sequential.

Parallel write tasks must have clearly separated scope and should not modify the same files, interfaces, schemas, migrations, or shared configuration.

Each delegated task must define:

* goal;
* scope and out-of-scope;
* relevant files or ownership boundary;
* dependencies;
* acceptance criteria;
* validation;
* expected result summary.

Subagents should return material findings, changes, test results, and unresolved risks rather than raw logs.

The main agent must not duplicate work already delegated to an active subagent.

Prefer a single delegation level. Subagents should not create further subagents unless explicitly required.

## Skill Routing

| Situation                                                              | Skill                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Non-trivial repository development lifecycle                           | `codex-development-workflow` |
| Large, unfamiliar, or context-heavy repository exploration             | `context-efficiency`         |
| Complex, multi-step, dependent, or incremental work                    | `plan-to-ticket`             |
| Feature, bug fix, regression, integration, or browser validation       | `test-workflow`              |
| Architecture or flow visualization materially improves understanding   | `plantuml-skill`             |
| Verified repository state materially changed                           | `repo-current-state`         |
| Potentially sensitive output crosses a sharing or publication boundary | `data-document-redaction`    |
| Deployment, release automation, rollout verification, or rollback      | `auto-deploy`                |
| Branch publication, Commit, Push, PR, Merge, or branch cleanup is required | `github-push-when-ready`     |
| Implementation and required validation are complete                    | `bark-finish-notify`         |

## Skill Rules

* Invoke Skills only when their trigger applies.
* Prefer the most specific applicable Skill.
* Follow the invoked Skill's `SKILL.md`.
* Do not duplicate Skill procedures here.
* Multiple Skills may be invoked when independent triggers apply.
* If a required Skill is unavailable, report it instead of inventing a replacement.

## Repository Rules

* Keep architecture and dependencies as simple as practical.
* One commit should represent one clear purpose.
* Never commit passwords, tokens, credentials, private keys, `.env`, or other secrets.
* Do not commit local `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` unless the repository intentionally versions them.

## Completion

A change is complete only after all applicable workflow gates have passed.

After implementation and required validation are complete, invoke `bark-finish-notify` once before the final response.
